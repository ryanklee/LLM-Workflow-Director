# LLM-Workflow Director

LLM-Workflow Director is a Python-based tool designed to assist in AI-driven software development. It aims to provide a structured approach to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) throughout the development lifecycle.

## Project Goals

- Streamline the integration of LLMs in software development processes
- Provide a configurable workflow system for AI-assisted development
- Maintain project state and progress across different development stages
- Offer a simple interface for developers to interact with LLMs in their workflow

## Key Features

- Configurable workflow stages and transitions
- Integration with various LLM models
- State management for tracking project progress
- Command-line interface for easy interaction
- Extensible architecture for custom plugins and LLM models
