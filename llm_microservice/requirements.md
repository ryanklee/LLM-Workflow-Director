# LLM Microservice API Requirements

1. General Requirements
   1.1. The microservice shall be implemented in Python.
   1.2. The microservice shall provide a RESTful API for communication with the main LLM-Workflow Director.
   1.3. The microservice shall integrate with the LLM CLI utility.
   1.4. The microservice shall support multiple LLM models, including but not limited to OpenAI, Anthropic, and PaLM.

2. API Endpoints
   2.1. The microservice shall provide an endpoint for generating LLM responses.
   2.2. The microservice shall provide an endpoint for evaluating the sufficiency of project stages.
   2.3. The microservice shall provide an endpoint for task breakdown and complex reasoning.
   2.4. The microservice shall provide an endpoint for retrieving cached results.

3. LLM Integration
   3.1. The microservice shall utilize the LLM CLI's templating system for generating consistent prompts.
   3.2. The microservice shall leverage the LLM CLI's built-in caching capabilities to optimize performance and reduce API costs.
   3.3. The microservice shall support streaming responses from the LLM CLI for long-running tasks.

4. Performance and Optimization
   4.1. The microservice shall implement caching mechanisms to store and reuse expensive LLM computations when appropriate.
   4.2. The microservice shall provide mechanisms to invalidate and update cached information when necessary.
   4.3. The microservice shall implement concurrent processing of LLM requests where applicable to improve overall system performance.

5. Error Handling and Logging
   5.1. The microservice shall implement robust error handling for LLM service communication.
   5.2. The microservice shall provide detailed logging for all operations and errors.
   5.3. The microservice shall implement retry mechanisms for failed LLM requests.

6. Security
   6.1. The microservice shall implement secure practices for handling API keys and sensitive information.
   6.2. The microservice shall validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.

7. Configuration and Extensibility
   7.1. The microservice shall provide configuration options for LLM model selection and API keys.
   7.2. The microservice shall support the addition of new LLM models or services in the future.
   7.3. The microservice shall allow for customization of prompt templates and LLM interaction patterns.

8. Monitoring and Health Checks
   8.1. The microservice shall implement health check endpoints for monitoring its status.
   8.2. The microservice shall provide metrics on request latency, cache hit rates, and error rates.

9. Documentation
   9.1. The microservice shall provide comprehensive API documentation.
   9.2. The microservice shall include usage examples for each endpoint.
   9.3. The microservice shall document the configuration options and deployment process.

10. Testing
    10.1. The microservice shall include a comprehensive test suite covering all major components and API endpoints.
    10.2. The microservice shall include integration tests with mock LLM services.
    10.3. The microservice shall provide mechanisms for simulating various LLM responses and error conditions for testing purposes.
