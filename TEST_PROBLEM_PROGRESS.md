# Test Problem Analysis and Progress

## Problem Description
The installation of pytest-pact>=0.3.0,<0.4.0 is failing with the error "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pytest-pact<0.4.0,>=0.3.0 (from versions: 0.0.0)".

## Updated Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. Package Availability Issue (Highest Likelihood)
   - The specified version range of pytest-pact (>=0.3.0,<0.4.0) is not available in the PyPI repository.
   - Validation: Check the available versions of pytest-pact on PyPI.
   - Status: Investigated and confirmed.

2. Dependency Conflict (Medium Likelihood)
   - There might be a conflict between pytest-pact and other installed packages.
   - Validation: Review the project's dependencies and check for any known conflicts with pytest-pact.
   - Status: To be investigated.

3. PyPI Repository Issues (Low Likelihood)
   - There might be temporary issues with the PyPI repository.
   - Validation: Attempt to install other packages or check PyPI status.
   - Status: To be investigated if other hypotheses are invalidated.

## New Learnings

1. The pytest-pact package versions between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0 are not available in the PyPI repository.
2. The only version of pytest-pact currently available is 0.0.0.
3. The project's requirements.txt file specifies a version range that doesn't exist.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate the pytest-pact package history and current status.
2. Consider alternative packages or solutions that provide similar functionality.
3. Update the requirements.txt file to either use the available version (0.0.0) or remove pytest-pact if it's not essential.
4. If pytest-pact is critical, research why the package versions are not available and consider contacting the package maintainers.

## Implementation Plan

1. Package Investigation:
   - Research the pytest-pact package on PyPI and GitHub to understand its current status.
   - Look for any announcements or issues related to version availability.

2. Alternative Solutions:
   - Research alternative packages that provide similar functionality to pytest-pact.
   - If pytest-pact is not critical, consider removing it from the project dependencies.

3. Update Requirements:
   - Modify requirements.txt to either use the available version (0.0.0) or remove pytest-pact.
   - If removing, ensure that no part of the project depends on pytest-pact.

4. Project Impact Assessment:
   - Review the project code to identify any usage of pytest-pact.
   - Assess the impact of removing or changing the pytest-pact version on the project.

5. Communication:
   - If pytest-pact is critical, consider reaching out to the package maintainers for information about version availability.

We will start by investigating the pytest-pact package history and current status, then proceed with updating the requirements.txt file based on our findings.

## Implementation Plan

1. Package Version Investigation:
   - Use `pip index versions pytest-pact` to check available versions.
   - Research the changelog or release notes of pytest-pact for compatibility information.

2. Dependency Analysis:
   - Review all packages in requirements.txt for potential conflicts.
   - Use a tool like `pipdeptree` to visualize dependency relationships.

3. Update Requirements:
   - Modify requirements.txt to specify a compatible version of pytest-pact or remove it if unnecessary.
   - Consider using version specifiers like `pytest-pact>=0.3.0,<0.4.0` for more flexibility.

4. Alternative Solutions:
   - Research alternative packages that provide similar functionality to pytest-pact.
   - If pytest-pact is not critical, consider removing it from the project dependencies.

5. Environment Testing:
   - Create a new virtual environment to test the installation of dependencies.
   - Attempt to install packages in a clean environment to isolate any local issues.

We will start by investigating the available versions of pytest-pact and updating the requirements.txt file accordingly.
