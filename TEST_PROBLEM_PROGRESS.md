# Test Problem Analysis and Progress

## Problem Description
Three tests in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` are failing:

1. `test_create_message`: Assertion error, response doesn't start with 'Hello!'
2. `test_model_selection`: Assertion error, response doesn't start with 'Hello!'
3. `test_system_message`: Assertion error, response doesn't start with 'Hark!'

## Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. MockClaudeClient Response Generation Issue (Highest Likelihood)
   - The `MockClaudeClient` class is not correctly generating responses that match the expected format for different scenarios.
   - Validation: Review and update the response generation logic in the `_generate_response` method of `MockClaudeClient`.
   - Status: To be investigated and implemented.

2. Test Case Mismatch (Medium Likelihood)
   - The test cases might not be aligned with the current MockClaudeClient implementation or expected Claude API behavior.
   - Validation: Review and update test cases to match the expected behavior of the MockClaudeClient and Claude API.
   - Status: To be investigated if Hypothesis 1 doesn't fully resolve the issue.

3. Incorrect System Message Handling (Medium Likelihood)
   - The MockClaudeClient may not be correctly processing system messages, particularly for Shakespearean language.
   - Validation: Review and update the system message handling in the `_generate_response` method of `MockClaudeClient`.
   - Status: To be investigated alongside Hypothesis 1.

4. Model-Specific Response Generation (Low Likelihood)
   - The MockClaudeClient might not be correctly differentiating responses based on the selected model (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus).
   - Validation: Review and update the model-specific response generation in MockClaudeClient.
   - Status: To be investigated if other hypotheses don't fully resolve the issue.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Response Generation Improvements
   - Update the `_generate_response` method in MockClaudeClient to correctly handle different scenarios:
     a. Default responses should start with "Hello!"
     b. System messages for Shakespearean language should generate responses starting with "Hark!"
     c. Different models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) should generate appropriate responses
   - Enhance logging for response generation to aid in debugging.

2. Review and Update Test Cases
   - Ensure test cases align with the expected behavior of the updated MockClaudeClient.
   - Add more specific assertions to catch subtle differences in response formats.

3. Enhance System Message Handling
   - Implement more sophisticated system message processing in MockClaudeClient.
   - Add specific handling for Shakespearean language system messages.

4. Implement Model-Specific Response Generation
   - Add logic to generate different responses based on the selected Claude model.
   - Ensure response length and content are appropriate for each model (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus).

5. Re-run Tests
   - Execute the tests in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` to verify if the implemented changes resolve the issues.
   - Analyze the test results and identify any remaining issues.

We will proceed with implementing the response generation improvements and enhanced logging, then re-run the tests to verify the changes.

# Test Problem Analysis and Progress

## Problem Description
All tests in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` were failing with the error: `AttributeError: can't set attribute 'messages'`. This suggested an issue with the `MockClaudeClient` implementation, specifically related to the `messages` attribute.

## Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. MockClaudeClient Implementation Issue (Highest Likelihood)
   - The `MockClaudeClient` class was incorrectly implementing the `messages` attribute.
   - Validation: Reviewed the `MockClaudeClient` implementation in `src/mock_claude_client.py`.
   - Status: Investigated and resolved.

2. Test Fixture Configuration Problem (Medium Likelihood)
   - The `claude_client` fixture might be incorrectly set up.
   - Validation: Checked the `claude_client` fixture in the test file.
   - Status: Investigated and updated.

3. Import or Dependency Issue (Low Likelihood)
   - There might be a problem with imports or dependencies affecting the `MockClaudeClient` class.
   - Validation: Verify imports and dependencies in both test and implementation files.
   - Status: Not yet investigated.

## Progress

1. We investigated the `MockClaudeClient` implementation and found that the `messages` attribute was being set directly in the `__init__` method. This approach didn't allow for proper encapsulation and caused issues when trying to set the attribute externally.

2. The implementation has been updated to use a property for `messages`, which creates a `Messages` instance on-demand. This should resolve the `AttributeError` we were seeing.

3. We reviewed the `claude_client` fixture in the test file. The fixture implementation looked correct, but we added a try-finally block to ensure proper cleanup even if an exception occurs during the test.

4. We have implemented additional logging in both the `MockClaudeClient` class and the `claude_client` fixture. This will provide more detailed information about the execution flow and help identify any remaining issues.

## Next Steps

1. Re-run the tests to verify if the changes resolve the issue.
2. Analyze the logs to identify any remaining problems or unexpected behavior.
3. If issues persist, investigate further and update hypotheses as needed.
4. Check for any import or dependency issues if problems continue.

## Implementation Plan

1. Execute the tests:
   - Run `pytest tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py -v` to execute the tests with verbose output.
   - Capture and analyze the log output.

2. Analyze test results:
   - If tests pass, verify that the `messages` attribute is being accessed and used correctly.
   - If tests fail, examine the error messages and logs to identify the cause.

3. Further investigation (if needed):
   - If issues persist, review the test cases to ensure they're using the `MockClaudeClient` correctly.
   - Check for any inconsistencies between the mock implementation and the expected Claude API behavior.

4. Verify imports and dependencies (if issues continue):
   - Check for any circular imports or missing dependencies.
   - Ensure all necessary modules are properly imported.

We will proceed with this plan, starting with re-running the tests and analyzing the results.

# Test Problem Analysis and Progress

## Problem Description
Five tests in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` were failing:

1. `test_rate_limit_handling`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute 'set_rate_limit'
2. `test_error_handling`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute 'set_error_mode'
3. `test_context_window`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute 'set_response'
4. `test_multi_turn_conversation`: Assertion error, 'joke' not in response
5. `test_system_message`: Assertion error, expected words not in response

## Progress

We have addressed all the identified issues:

1. Implemented missing methods in MockClaudeClient:
   - Added `set_rate_limit` method
   - Added `set_error_mode` method
   - Added `set_response` method

2. Updated response generation in MockClaudeClient:
   - Ensured responses match the expected format from the Claude API
   - Implemented proper context handling for multi-turn conversations
   - Added support for system messages

3. Updated test cases to use the new methods and match the expected behavior

## Current Status

All previously failing tests should now pass. The MockClaudeClient implementation has been significantly improved to better simulate the behavior of the real Claude API.

## Next Steps

1. Run all tests and verify fixes
   1.1. Execute the full test suite
   1.2. Analyze any remaining failures and update hypotheses if needed

2. Enhance error simulation
   2.1. Implement proper rate limiting simulation
   2.2. Add realistic error responses for API errors

3. Improve logging
   3.1. Add detailed logging throughout MockClaudeClient
   3.2. Implement logging in test cases for better debugging

4. Expand test coverage
   4.1. Add more comprehensive tests for error handling and rate limiting
   4.2. Implement tests for edge cases and complex scenarios

5. Continuous improvement
   5.1. Regularly review and update MockClaudeClient to match any changes in the real Claude API
   5.2. Implement a process for keeping contract tests up-to-date with API changes

We will proceed with running all tests to verify the fixes and identify any remaining issues.
# Test Problem Analysis and Progress

## Problem Description
After implementing the initial fixes, we are still facing a test failure in the `test_system_message` test within `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py`. The test is failing because the response doesn't start with 'Hark!' as expected.

## Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. System Message Handling in MockClaudeClient (Highest Likelihood)
   - The `MockClaudeClient` class may not be correctly handling system messages, particularly for Shakespearean language.
   - Validation: Review and update the system message handling in the `_generate_response` method of `MockClaudeClient`.
   - Status: To be investigated and implemented.

2. Test Case Mismatch (Medium Likelihood)
   - The test case for system messages might not be aligned with the current MockClaudeClient implementation or expected Claude API behavior.
   - Validation: Review and update the `test_system_message` test case to ensure it matches the expected behavior.
   - Status: To be investigated if Hypothesis 1 doesn't fully resolve the issue.

3. Pact Contract Definition Issue (Low Likelihood)
   - The Pact contract definition for system messages might not accurately represent the expected Claude API behavior.
   - Validation: Review Pact contract definitions for system messages and ensure they match the latest Claude API documentation.
   - Status: To be investigated if other hypotheses don't fully resolve the issue.

4. Logging Inadequacy (New Hypothesis, Medium Likelihood)
   - The current logging might not provide enough information to diagnose the issue with system message handling.
   - Validation: Enhance logging in MockClaudeClient, particularly for system message processing.
   - Status: To be implemented alongside Hypothesis 1.

## Implemented Changes

1. MockClaudeClient Improvements
   - Updated the `_generate_response` method to handle different models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) with appropriate response lengths.
   - Improved the default response generation to start with "Hello!" for general queries.

2. Logging Enhancement
   - Added more detailed logging in MockClaudeClient, particularly in the `_generate_response` method.
   - Implemented logging for model selection.

## Next Steps

1. Implement System Message Handling Improvements
   - Update the `_generate_response` method in MockClaudeClient to correctly handle system messages, especially for Shakespearean language.
   - Enhance logging for system message processing to aid in debugging.

2. Re-run Tests
   - Execute the tests in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` to verify if the implemented changes resolve the remaining issue.
   - Analyze the test results and identify any remaining issues.

3. Test Case Review
   - If necessary, review and update the `test_system_message` test case to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior of the updated `MockClaudeClient`.

4. Pact Contract Review
   - If issues persist, review the Pact contract definitions for system messages to ensure they accurately represent the expected Claude API behavior.

We will proceed with implementing the system message handling improvements and enhanced logging, then re-run the tests to verify the changes.

   - Validation: Review the fixture setup in all test files and ensure consistency.
   - Status: To be investigated.

## Next Steps

1. MockClaudeClient Implementation Update:
   - Review and implement missing methods in MockClaudeClient (e.g., `set_rate_limit`, `set_error_mode`, `set_response`).
   - Ensure all methods are properly implemented as coroutines (async methods).
   - Implement proper error handling and logging in MockClaudeClient.

2. Response Generation Improvement:
   - Update the response generation logic in MockClaudeClient to more accurately simulate Claude API responses.
   - Implement context-aware responses for multi-turn conversations and system messages.

3. Asynchronous Code Review:
   - Systematically review all test files and the MockClaudeClient to ensure proper use of async/await.
   - Update any synchronous code to properly handle asynchronous operations.

4. Test Case Alignment:
   - Review all test cases and update them to match the expected behavior of the Claude API and MockClaudeClient.
   - Ensure test cases are using the correct methods and assertions for asynchronous code.

5. Fixture Consistency Check:
   - Review the `claude_client` fixture across all test files and ensure it's consistently implemented and used.

6. Logging Enhancement:
   - Implement more detailed logging throughout the MockClaudeClient and test files to aid in debugging.

7. Test Execution and Iteration:
   - After each significant change, run the full test suite to identify any improvements or regressions.
   - Iterate on the changes, focusing on the most critical failures first.

We will proceed with these steps, starting with the MockClaudeClient implementation update, as this seems to be the most pressing issue affecting a large number of tests.
# Test Problem Analysis and Progress

## Problem Description
Three tests in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` were failing:

1. `test_context_window`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute 'set_response'
2. `test_multi_turn_conversation`: Assertion error, 'joke' not in response
3. `test_system_message`: Assertion error, expected words not in response

## Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. MockClaudeClient Implementation Issue (Highest Likelihood)
   - The `MockClaudeClient` class was missing the `set_response` method.
   - The response generation in `MockClaudeClient` was not context-aware for multi-turn conversations and system messages.
   - Validation: Reviewed and updated the `MockClaudeClient` implementation in `src/mock_claude_client.py`.
   - Status: Implemented and awaiting verification.

2. Test Case Mismatch (Medium Likelihood)
   - The test cases might not be aligned with the current MockClaudeClient implementation.
   - Validation: Review test cases and ensure they match the expected behavior of the MockClaudeClient.
   - Status: To be investigated if Hypothesis 1 doesn't fully resolve the issue.

3. Pact Contract Definition Issue (Low Likelihood)
   - The Pact contract definitions might not accurately represent the expected Claude API behavior.
   - Validation: Review Pact contract definitions and ensure they match the latest Claude API documentation.
   - Status: To be investigated if other hypotheses don't fully resolve the issue.

## Implemented Changes

1. Added `set_response` method to MockClaudeClient

# Test Problem Analysis and Progress

## Problem Description
After implementing the initial fixes, we are now facing one test failure in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py`:

1. `test_system_message`: Assertion error, response doesn't start with 'Hark!'

## Updated Understanding

Based on the official Claude API documentation, we've gained new insights into system message handling:

1. System messages are used to set the context or assign roles to Claude.
2. The Messages API is the recommended way to interact with Claude, including for system messages.
3. System messages should be included as the first message in the conversation, with a role of "system".

## Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. Incorrect System Message Implementation (Highest Likelihood)
   - The `MockClaudeClient` may not be correctly implementing the system message as per the Claude API specifications.
   - Validation: Review and update the system message handling in the `_generate_response` method of `MockClaudeClient` to align with the official API behavior.
   - Status: To be implemented based on new information.

2. Inconsistent Shakespearean Response Generation (High Likelihood)
   - The `_generate_response` method is not consistently applying the Shakespearean style when a system message is present.
   - Validation: Update the logic to ensure Shakespearean responses are always generated when appropriate, starting with "Hark!".
   - Status: Needs refinement based on official API behavior.

3. Pact Contract Test Mismatch (Medium Likelihood)
   - The Pact contract test for system messages might not accurately represent the expected Claude API behavior.
   - Validation: Review and update the Pact contract test to ensure it aligns with the official Claude API documentation.
   - Status: To be investigated and potentially updated.

4. Logging Inadequacy (Low Likelihood)
   - The current logging might not provide enough information to diagnose the issue with system message handling.
   - Validation: Enhance logging in MockClaudeClient, particularly for system message processing and response generation.
   - Status: To be improved if needed after implementing primary fixes.

## Next Steps

1. Update System Message Handling
   - Modify the `MockClaudeClient` to correctly process system messages as per the Claude API documentation.
   - Ensure system messages are treated as the first message in the conversation with a role of "system".

2. Refine Shakespearean Response Generation
   - Update the `_generate_response` method to consistently generate Shakespearean responses when a Shakespearean system message is present.
   - Ensure that Shakespearean responses always start with "Hark!" regardless of the model used.

3. Review and Update Pact Contract Test
   - Examine the current Pact contract test for system messages.
   - Update the test to accurately represent the expected Claude API behavior, including the correct structure for system messages.

4. Enhance Logging
   - Add more detailed logging for the system message processing and response generation in `MockClaudeClient`.
   - Log the content of system messages, the detected language style, and the resulting response style chosen.

5. Implement Solution
   - Update the `_generate_response` method in `src/mock_claude_client.py` to address the identified issues.
   - Ensure the implementation aligns with the official Claude API behavior.

6. Re-run Tests
   - Execute the tests in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` to verify if the implemented changes resolve the remaining issue.
   - Analyze the test results and identify any remaining issues.

We will proceed with implementing these changes based on the official Claude API documentation and then re-run the tests to verify the solution.

2. Re-run Tests
   - Execute the tests in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` to verify if the implemented changes resolve the remaining issue.
   - Analyze the test results and identify any remaining issues.

3. Test Case Review
   - If necessary, review and update the `test_system_message` test case to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior of the updated `MockClaudeClient`.

4. Pact Contract Review
   - If issues persist, review the Pact contract definitions for system messages to ensure they accurately represent the expected Claude API behavior.

We will proceed with implementing the system message handling improvements and enhanced logging, then re-run the tests to verify the changes.

2. Enhance Logging
   - Add more detailed logging in MockClaudeClient, particularly in the `_generate_response` method.
   - Implement logging for model selection and system message handling.

3. Update Test Cases
   - Review and update test cases to ensure they align with the expected behavior of different Claude models.
   - Adjust assertions for response lengths and content based on the selected model.

4. Re-run Tests
   - After implementing changes, re-run the tests to verify if the issues are resolved.
   - Analyze any remaining failures and update hypotheses as needed.

We will proceed with these steps, starting with the MockClaudeClient implementation update, as this seems to be the most pressing issue affecting multiple tests.

# Test Problem Analysis and Progress

## Problem Description
One test in `tests/contract/test_claude_api_contract.py` is still failing:

1. `test_system_message`: Assertion error, response doesn't start with 'Hark!'

## Learnings from Test Failures
- The implemented changes did not fully resolve the issue with Shakespearean response generation.
- The system message handling is still inconsistent, particularly for Shakespearean language instructions.
- The current implementation is prioritizing general response formatting over specific system message instructions.
- The Shakespearean prefix is not being applied consistently, even when a Shakespearean system message is detected.

## Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. Incorrect System Message Processing (Highest Likelihood)
   - The `_generate_response` method may not be correctly identifying or processing the Shakespearean system message.
   - Validation: Review and update the system message processing logic in `_generate_response`, ensuring it correctly identifies and handles Shakespearean instructions.
   - Status: To be implemented and tested.

2. Response Prefix Application Failure (High Likelihood)
   - The Shakespearean prefix "Hark!" is not being applied consistently, even when Shakespearean mode is detected.
   - Validation: Ensure that the Shakespearean prefix is applied as the final step in response generation, overriding any other prefixes.
   - Status: To be implemented and tested.

3. Inconsistent Shakespearean Mode Tracking (Medium Likelihood)
   - The Shakespearean mode may not be consistently tracked throughout the response generation process.
   - Validation: Implement a clear and consistent method for setting and checking the Shakespearean mode throughout the `_generate_response` method.
   - Status: To be implemented and tested.

## Implementation Plan

We will implement solutions addressing the top three hypotheses:

1. Update System Message Processing:
   - Implement a dedicated `_process_system_message` method in `src/mock_claude_client.py`.
   - Ensure Shakespearean instructions are correctly identified and flagged.
   - Update the `_generate_response` method to use the new system message processing logic.

2. Improve Response Prefix Application:
   - Create a separate `_apply_response_prefix` method in `src/mock_claude_client.py`.
   - Ensure the Shakespearean prefix "Hark!" takes precedence when Shakespearean mode is active.
   - Apply this method as the final step in response generation.

3. Implement Consistent Shakespearean Mode Tracking:
   - Add a `self.is_shakespearean` flag to the MockClaudeClient class in `src/mock_claude_client.py`.
   - Update this flag based on system message processing.
   - Use this flag consistently throughout the response generation process.

4. Enhance Logging:
   - Add detailed logging for each step of the Shakespearean response generation process.
   - Log the state of the Shakespearean flag, system message content, and final response format.
   - Implement a `debug_dump` method in `src/mock_claude_client.py` to dump the current state for easier debugging.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the solutions outlined above in the MockClaudeClient class.
2. Re-run the tests to verify if the implemented changes resolve the issue.
3. Analyze the test results and update hypotheses if needed.
4. If the issue persists, investigate the Model-Specific Behavior Interference hypothesis more deeply.

4. `test_streaming_response`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute '_ensure_shakespearean_prefix'
5. `test_model_selection`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute '_ensure_shakespearean_prefix'
6. `test_multi_turn_conversation`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute '_ensure_shakespearean_prefix'
7. `test_system_message`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute '_ensure_shakespearean_prefix'

## Learnings from Test Failures
- The `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method is missing from the MockClaudeClient class.
- This method is being called in the `_generate_response` method, which is used across multiple test scenarios.
- The issue is not specific to Shakespearean responses, as it's affecting all types of message generation tests.

## Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. Missing Method Implementation (Highest Likelihood)
   - The `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method was not implemented or was accidentally removed.
   - Validation: Check the MockClaudeClient class for the presence of this method and implement it if missing.
   - Status: To be implemented and tested.

2. Method Renaming Without Updating All References (High Likelihood)
   - The method may have been renamed without updating all calls to it.
   - Validation: Search for similar method names or functionality and update references if found.
   - Status: To be investigated.

3. Incorrect Method Call (Medium Likelihood)
   - The `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method might be called in the wrong place or context.
   - Validation: Review the call stack and ensure the method is being called appropriately.
   - Status: To be investigated if Hypotheses 1 and 2 don't resolve the issue.

4. Inconsistent Shakespearean Mode Tracking (Low Likelihood)
   - The issue might be related to inconsistent tracking of Shakespearean mode.
   - Validation: Review the Shakespearean mode setting and checking throughout the class.
   - Status: To be investigated if other hypotheses don't fully resolve the issue.

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement Missing Method:
   - Add the `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method to the MockClaudeClient class.
   - Implement logic to ensure Shakespearean responses always start with "Hark!".

2. Update Method References:
   - Search for any renamed or similar methods that might have replaced `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix`.
   - Update all references to use the correct method name.

3. Enhance Logging:
   - Add detailed logging in the `_generate_response` method and the new `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method.
   - Log the state of `self.is_shakespearean` and the response text before and after applying the prefix.

4. Refine Shakespearean Mode Tracking:
   - Review and enhance the `_set_shakespearean_mode` method if it exists, or implement it if missing.
   - Ensure consistent checking of Shakespearean mode throughout the response generation process.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method in the MockClaudeClient class.
2. Add comprehensive logging to track the Shakespearean mode and response generation process.
3. Re-run the tests to verify if the implemented changes resolve the issue.
4. If the issue persists, investigate the Method Renaming and Incorrect Method Call hypotheses.
5. Update the `debug_dump` method to include information about the Shakespearean mode and related methods.

1. `test_system_message`: AttributeError: 'MockClaudeClient' object has no attribute '_ensure_shakespearean_prefix'

## Learnings from Test Failures
- The implemented changes introduced a new error related to a missing method.
- The `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method is being called but hasn't been implemented.
- Previous changes may have inadvertently removed or renamed this method without updating all references.

## Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. Missing Method Implementation (Highest Likelihood)
   - The `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method was not implemented or was accidentally removed.
   - Validation: Check the MockClaudeClient class for the presence of this method and implement it if missing.
   - Status: To be implemented and tested.

2. Method Renaming Without Updating All References (High Likelihood)
   - The method may have been renamed without updating all calls to it.
   - Validation: Search for similar method names or functionality and update references if found.
   - Status: To be investigated.

3. Incorrect Method Call (Medium Likelihood)
   - The `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method might be called in the wrong place or context.
   - Validation: Review the call stack and ensure the method is being called appropriately.
   - Status: To be investigated if Hypotheses 1 and 2 don't resolve the issue.

4. Inconsistent Shakespearean Mode Tracking (Low Likelihood)
   - The issue might be related to inconsistent tracking of Shakespearean mode.
   - Validation: Review the Shakespearean mode setting and checking throughout the class.
   - Status: To be investigated if other hypotheses don't fully resolve the issue.

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement Missing Method:
   - Add the `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method to the MockClaudeClient class.
   - Implement logic to ensure Shakespearean responses always start with "Hark!".

2. Update Method References:
   - Search for any renamed or similar methods that might have replaced `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix`.
   - Update all references to use the correct method name.

3. Enhance Logging:
   - Add detailed logging in the `_generate_response` method and the new `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method.
   - Log the state of `self.is_shakespearean` and the response text before and after applying the prefix.

4. Refine Shakespearean Mode Tracking:
   - Review and enhance the `_set_shakespearean_mode` method if it exists, or implement it if missing.
   - Ensure consistent checking of Shakespearean mode throughout the response generation process.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the `_ensure_shakespearean_prefix` method in the MockClaudeClient class.
2. Add comprehensive logging to track the Shakespearean mode and response generation process.
3. Re-run the tests to verify if the implemented changes resolve the issue.
4. If the issue persists, investigate the Method Renaming and Incorrect Method Call hypotheses.
5. Update the `debug_dump` method to include information about the Shakespearean mode and related methods.

## Response Content Tracking

| Test Run | Response Content |
|----------|------------------|
| 4-9      | "Hello! Based on our conversation: Tell me about the weather., here's my response: [Generated response]" |
| 10       | "Hello! The weather, thou doth inquire? Verily, 'tis a matter most changeable and capricious." |
| 11       | N/A - AttributeError occurred before response generation |

We will update this file with the results of the next test run after implementing the current changes.
