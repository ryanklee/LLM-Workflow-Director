# Development Process for LLM-Workflow Director

This project is being developed as a collaboration between a human developer and an AI assistant. There are no external contributors or stakeholders involved. This document outlines the development process and guidelines for this unique collaboration.

## Development Workflow

1. The human developer proposes changes or new features.
2. The AI assistant provides suggestions, code snippets, and guidance.
3. The human developer implements the changes, potentially with further assistance from the AI.
4. The human developer reviews and tests the changes.
5. The changes are committed to the repository.

## Code Style and Standards

* Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
* Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
* Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
* Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
* Write unit tests for new functionality.

## Version Control

* Use Git for version control.
* Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, explaining the reason for the change.
* Use feature branches for developing new features or major changes.

## Documentation

* Keep the README.md file up to date with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
* Update documentation when making changes to the API or adding new features.
* Use inline comments to explain complex logic or algorithms.

## Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality.
* Ensure all tests pass before committing changes.
* Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical components.

## Error Handling and Logging

* Implement proper error handling throughout the codebase.
* Use logging to track important events and errors.

## Security

* Be mindful of security best practices when handling user input or sensitive data.
* Do not commit sensitive information (like API keys) to the repository.

## Continuous Improvement

* Regularly review and refactor code to improve readability and efficiency.
* Stay updated with the latest best practices and technologies relevant to the project.

Remember, this is a collaborative effort between you and the AI assistant. Feel free to discuss any aspects of the development process or seek clarification on suggestions provided by the AI.
