# LLM API Testing Best Practices

## 1. Task-Specific Testing

1.1. Design Comprehensive Test Cases:
- Create test cases that mirror real-world task distribution.
- Include edge cases and potential failure modes.
- Cover a wide range of inputs and expected outputs.

1.2. Automated Evaluation:
- Structure questions to allow for automated grading where possible.
- Use multiple-choice, string matching, or code-graded evaluations for simple cases.
- Implement LLM-based grading for more complex judgments.

## 2. LLM-Based Grading

2.1. Implement LLMEvaluator:
- Use a separate LLM instance for evaluating responses.
- Provide clear rubrics for grading criteria.
- Encourage step-by-step reasoning in the grading process.

2.2. Robust Evaluation Prompts:
- Design prompts that focus on specific, measurable criteria.
- Use structured output formats (e.g., XML tags) for consistent parsing.

## 3. Consistency and Reliability Testing

3.1. Test for Consistent Outputs:
- Verify that similar inputs produce consistent outputs.
- Use cosine similarity or other metrics to measure output consistency.

3.2. Implement Retry Mechanisms:
- Test the system's ability to handle temporary errors.
- Verify that retry logic works as expected.

## 4. Performance and Scalability

4.1. Response Time Tracking:
- Measure and log response times for LLM API calls.
- Set performance benchmarks and alert on significant deviations.

4.2. Load Testing:
- Simulate high-load scenarios to test system performance.
- Verify that the system can handle expected peak loads.

## 5. Security and Compliance

5.1. Input Validation:
- Test with various input types, including potentially malicious inputs.
- Verify that the system properly sanitizes inputs before processing.

5.2. Output Filtering:
- Implement and test mechanisms to filter out sensitive or inappropriate content.
- Verify that the system handles unexpected or malformed LLM outputs gracefully.

## 6. Continuous Improvement

6.1. Version Control:
- Maintain version control for test cases, prompts, and evaluation criteria.
- Document changes and rationale for modifications.

6.2. Performance Tracking:
- Implement a system to track test results over time.
- Use this data to identify trends and areas for improvement.

By following these best practices, we ensure a robust and reliable testing framework for our LLM-based system, leading to higher quality and more dependable AI-assisted workflows.
