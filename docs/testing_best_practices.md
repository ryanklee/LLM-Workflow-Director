# LLM API Testing Best Practices

## 1. Unit Testing

1.1. Mock LLM API Responses:
- Use a mocking library (e.g., unittest.mock) to simulate LLM API responses.
- Create a variety of mock responses to cover different scenarios (success, failure, edge cases).
- Ensure mocked responses match the structure of actual API responses.

1.2. Test Input Validation:
- Verify that your code properly validates and sanitizes inputs before sending them to the LLM API.
- Test with various input types and edge cases (empty strings, very long inputs, special characters).

1.3. Test Error Handling:
- Simulate API errors (e.g., rate limiting, authentication failures) and verify proper error handling.
- Ensure your code gracefully handles unexpected response formats.

1.4. Test Parsing and Processing:
- Verify that your code correctly parses and processes the LLM API responses.
- Test with different response structures and content types.

## 2. Integration Testing

2.1. Limited Live API Calls:
- Use a small number of actual API calls in integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality.
- Cache API responses for repeated use to minimize costs and API usage.

2.2. Test Retry Mechanisms:
- Verify that your code properly implements retry logic for transient errors.
- Test with simulated network failures and API timeouts.

## 3. Qualitative Evaluation

3.1. Human Evaluation:
- Implement a system for human reviewers to assess the quality of LLM outputs.
- Define clear evaluation criteria (e.g., relevance, coherence, factual accuracy).

3.2. Comparative Testing:
- Compare outputs from different LLM models or versions to assess improvements or regressions.
- Use established benchmarks or create custom test sets for your specific use case.

## 4. Quantitative Evaluation

4.1. Metrics:
- Implement relevant metrics for your use case (e.g., BLEU score for translation, perplexity for language modeling).
- Track performance metrics over time to identify trends or regressions.

4.2. Response Time and Latency:
- Measure and log response times for LLM API calls.
- Set performance benchmarks and alert on significant deviations.

## 5. Continuous Monitoring

5.1. Logging and Alerting:
- Implement comprehensive logging for all LLM API interactions.
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns, errors, or performance issues.

5.2. A/B Testing:
- Use A/B testing to compare different prompts, models, or integration strategies in production.

## 6. Security and Compliance

6.1. Data Privacy:
- Ensure that no sensitive information is sent to the LLM API in tests.
- Verify that your code properly handles and stores any sensitive information in responses.

6.2. API Key Management:
- Use separate API keys for testing and production environments.
- Implement secure storage and rotation of API keys.

## 7. Version Control and Documentation

7.1. Prompt Versioning:
- Version control your prompts and test cases.
- Document changes and rationale for prompt modifications.

7.2. Test Documentation:
- Maintain clear documentation of test cases, including expected behaviors and edge cases.
- Update documentation when adding new features or changing LLM integration strategies.

By following these best practices, we can ensure robust and reliable testing of our LLM API integration, leading to higher quality and more dependable AI-assisted workflows.
