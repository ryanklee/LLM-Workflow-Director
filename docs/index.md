## Key Concepts

- **Workflow Stages**: The project is divided into distinct stages, each with specific tasks and objectives.
- **LLM Integration**: The system leverages Anthropic's Claude models for AI-assisted development.
- **State Management**: A robust state management system tracks project progress and artifacts.
- **Constraint Engine**: Enforces rules and best practices throughout the development process.
- **Sufficiency Evaluation**: Uses LLM capabilities to assess the completeness of each stage.
