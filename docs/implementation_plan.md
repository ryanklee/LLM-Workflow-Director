2. Context Window Management: Risk of inefficient use of Claude's 200k token context window.
   Mitigation: Develop advanced context summarization and management techniques.

3. Integration Complexity: Risk of increased system complexity due to multiple integrations.
   Mitigation: Maintain modular architecture and comprehensive documentation.

4. Performance Bottlenecks: Risk of system slowdowns with increased usage and data volume.
   Mitigation: Regular performance profiling and optimization.

5. Security Concerns: Risk of exposing sensitive information in prompts or logs.
   Mitigation: Implement strict security measures and data sanitization processes.

6. Mocking Accuracy: Risk of mocks not accurately representing real API behavior.
   Mitigation: Regularly validate mocks against real API responses, update as needed.

7. Test Flakiness: Risk of parallel test execution introducing flaky tests.
   Mitigation: Carefully design tests to be truly independent, use test isolation techniques.

8. Increased Test Complexity: Risk of test suite becoming difficult to maintain.
   Mitigation: Maintain clear documentation, conduct regular code reviews of tests.

Regularly review and update this risk assessment as the project progresses.

Continue to prioritize Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles throughout all phases of development. Regularly review and update the implementation plan as needed to ensure all new requirements are properly addressed and the test suite remains robust and efficient.

## Risk Assessment

1. Mocking Accuracy: Risk of mocks not accurately representing real API behavior.
   Mitigation: Regularly validate mocks against real API responses, update as needed.

2. Test Flakiness: Risk of parallel test execution introducing flaky tests.
   Mitigation: Carefully design tests to be truly independent, use test isolation techniques.

3. Increased Test Complexity: Risk of test suite becoming difficult to maintain.
   Mitigation: Maintain clear documentation, conduct regular code reviews of tests.

4. Performance Impact: Risk of optimization efforts negatively impacting development speed.
   Mitigation: Balance optimization with developer productivity, focus on high-impact improvements.

5. Over-reliance on Mocks: Risk of tests passing with mocks but failing with real API.
   Mitigation: Implement integration tests with real API calls in addition to mocked tests.

Regularly review and update this risk assessment as the project progresses.
