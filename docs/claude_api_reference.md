# Claude API Reference

## Key Features for LLM-Workflow Director

1. Models:
   - Claude 3 Haiku: Fast and cost-effective
   - Claude 3 Sonnet: Balanced performance
   - Claude 3 Opus: Most capable
   All support 200k token context window and vision input

2. API Integration:
   ```python
   from anthropic import Anthropic
   client = Anthropic()
   message = client.messages.create(
       model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
       max_tokens=1000,
       temperature=0.7,
       system="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
       messages=[
           {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude!"}
       ]
   )
   ```

3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices:
   - Use clear, specific instructions
   - Provide context and examples
   - Use system prompts for role-setting
   - Leverage XML tags for structured outputs
   - Implement chain-of-thought prompting for complex tasks

4. Structured Output Example:
   ```xml
   <instruction>
   Please provide a summary in the following format:
   <summary>
   <main_points>[List main points]</main_points>
   <key_takeaways>[List key takeaways]</key_takeaways>
   </summary>
   </instruction>
   ```

5. Tool Use Integration:
   - Define available tools in system prompt
   - Provide clear instructions for tool use
   - Parse Claude's responses to execute tool calls
   - Feed results back to Claude for processing

6. Vision Capabilities:
   - Include base64-encoded images or image URLs in messages
   - Provide clear instructions for image analysis

7. Error Handling and Monitoring:
   - Implement exponential backoff for API call retries
   - Handle common API errors (rate limits, authentication issues)
   - Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting
   - Set up logging and alerting for API interactions

8. Security Considerations:
   - Store API keys securely (environment variables, secret management systems)
   - Implement input validation and sanitization
   - Be cautious with user-generated content in prompts
   - Implement output filtering for sensitive information
   - Regularly audit and rotate API keys

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the official Anthropic documentation.
