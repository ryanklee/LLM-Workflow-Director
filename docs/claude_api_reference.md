# Claude API Reference

## Models

Claude offers three main models:

1. Claude 3 Haiku: Fast and cost-effective
2. Claude 3 Sonnet: Balanced performance
3. Claude 3 Opus: Most capable

All models support:
- 200k token context window
- Multilingual capabilities
- Vision input

## API Integration

### Installation

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

### Authentication

Set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0.7,
    system="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude!"}
    ]
)

print(message.content)
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

1. Use clear and specific instructions
2. Provide context and examples
3. Use system prompts to set the assistant's role and behavior
4. Leverage XML tags for structured outputs
5. Implement chain-of-thought prompting for complex tasks
6. Use multi-shot learning for consistent outputs

## Tool Use

Claude can use external tools to enhance its capabilities. Implement tool use by:

1. Defining available tools in the system prompt
2. Providing clear instructions on when and how to use tools
3. Parsing Claude's responses to execute tool calls
4. Feeding tool results back to Claude for further processing

## Vision Capabilities

To use Claude's vision capabilities:

1. Include image data in the messages array
2. Use base64-encoded images or image URLs
3. Provide clear instructions on how to analyze or interact with the image

## Long Context Handling

When working with long contexts:

1. Use clear section headers and separators
2. Prioritize important information at the beginning and end of the context
3. Use summarization techniques for lengthy content
4. Implement efficient prompting strategies to maximize context utilization

## Error Handling and Rate Limiting

1. Implement exponential backoff for API call retries
2. Handle common API errors (e.g., rate limits, authentication issues)
3. Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting as needed

## Security Considerations

1. Store API keys securely (e.g., environment variables, secret management systems)
2. Implement input validation and sanitization
3. Be cautious with user-generated content in prompts
4. Implement output filtering for sensitive information
