# Claude API Reference

## Models and Cost Management

Claude offers three main models:

1. Claude 3 Haiku: Fast and cost-effective
2. Claude 3 Sonnet: Balanced performance
3. Claude 3 Opus: Most capable

All models support:
- 200k token context window
- Multilingual capabilities
- Vision input

To optimize API costs and usage:
1. Use the appropriate model tier for each task
2. Implement caching for repeated queries
3. Batch similar requests when possible
4. Monitor and analyze usage patterns
5. Set up usage alerts and limits

## API Integration

### Installation

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

### Authentication

Set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0.7,
    system="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude!"}
    ]
)

print(message.content)
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

1. Use clear and specific instructions
2. Provide context and examples
3. Use system prompts to set the assistant's role and behavior
4. Leverage XML tags for structured outputs
5. Implement chain-of-thought prompting for complex tasks
6. Use multi-shot learning for consistent outputs

### Structured Output with XML Tags

Example:
```xml
<instruction>
Please provide a summary of the text in the following format:
<summary>
<main_points>
[List the main points here]
</main_points>
<key_takeaways>
[List key takeaways here]
</key_takeaways>
</summary>
</instruction>
```

### Leveraging Claude's Reasoning Capabilities

1. Use step-by-step instructions for complex tasks
2. Encourage Claude to "think aloud" and explain its reasoning
3. Use chain-of-thought prompting for multi-step problem-solving
4. Provide examples of desired reasoning processes
5. Ask Claude to evaluate its own responses and refine them

## Fine-tuning Prompts for Performance and Consistency

1. Iterate on prompts based on Claude's responses
2. Use clear and consistent formatting across similar tasks
3. Provide examples of desired outputs
4. Use system messages to set context and expectations
5. Experiment with different prompt structures and phrasings
6. Implement A/B testing for critical prompts

## Tool Use and Workflow Integration

Claude can use external tools to enhance its capabilities. Implement tool use by:

1. Defining available tools in the system prompt
2. Providing clear instructions on when and how to use tools
3. Parsing Claude's responses to execute tool calls
4. Feeding tool results back to Claude for further processing

Strategies for integrating Claude into larger workflows:

1. Use Claude as a task router or orchestrator
2. Implement Claude for data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Use Claude for generating intermediate results or subtasks
4. Integrate Claude's outputs with other AI models or traditional software systems
5. Implement feedback loops to improve Claude's performance over time

## Vision Capabilities

To use Claude's vision capabilities:

1. Include image data in the messages array using base64-encoded images or image URLs
2. Provide clear instructions on how to analyze or interact with the image
3. Use the `vision` parameter when creating a message to enable image analysis

Example:
```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1000,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "base64",
                        "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                        "data": "base64_encoded_image_data"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What's in this image?"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

## Embeddings

Claude can generate embeddings for text, which can be used for semantic search, clustering, or other NLP tasks:

1. Use the `create` method of the `client.embeddings` object
2. Provide the text to be embedded and specify the model
3. Receive a vector representation of the input text

Example:
```python
embedding = client.embeddings.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    input="Hello, world!"
)
print(embedding.embedding)
```

## Text Generation

For text generation tasks:

1. Use clear and specific prompts
2. Experiment with temperature and top_p settings
3. Use system messages to set the tone and style
4. Implement content filtering for generated text

## Evaluation and Testing

1. Use the Claude Evaluation Tool for systematic prompt testing
2. Define clear success criteria for each task
3. Develop comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios
4. Implement automated testing in your development pipeline

## Security and Compliance

1. Anthropic is SOC 2 Type 2 certified
2. Use the provided data processing addendum (DPA) for GDPR compliance
3. Implement proper access controls and audit logging in your application
4. Be aware of data retention policies and implement necessary controls

## API Versioning and Updates

1. Anthropic uses semantic versioning for API updates
2. Major versions may introduce breaking changes
3. Stay informed about deprecation notices and upgrade paths
4. Test your integration with new API versions before upgrading in production

## Rate Limits

1. Default rate limit is 5 requests per minute (RPM) per API key
2. Higher rate limits available for enterprise customers
3. Implement proper error handling for rate limit errors (HTTP 429)
4. Use exponential backoff for retries

## Anthropic Cookbook and Prompt Library

1. Refer to the Anthropic Cookbook for best practices and advanced techniques
2. Utilize the Prompt Library for pre-built prompts for common tasks
3. Adapt and customize prompts from the library for your specific use cases

## Long Context Handling

When working with long contexts:

1. Use clear section headers and separators
2. Prioritize important information at the beginning and end of the context
3. Use summarization techniques for lengthy content
4. Implement efficient prompting strategies to maximize context utilization

## Error Handling and Monitoring

1. Implement exponential backoff for API call retries
2. Handle common API errors (e.g., rate limits, authentication issues)
3. Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting as needed
4. Set up logging and alerting for API interactions

## Security Considerations

1. Store API keys securely (e.g., environment variables, secret management systems)
2. Implement input validation and sanitization
3. Be cautious with user-generated content in prompts
4. Implement output filtering for sensitive information
5. Regularly audit and rotate API keys
