# Claude Integration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of Anthropic's Claude models into the LLM-Workflow Director, including best practices for prompt engineering and utilizing Claude's unique capabilities.

## Supported Claude Models
1. Claude 3 Haiku: Fast and cost-effective
2. Claude 3 Sonnet: Balance of speed and intelligence
3. Claude 3 Opus: Excels at writing and complex tasks

## Key Features
- 200k context window for all models
- Advanced reasoning and task completion capabilities
- Multilingual support
- Vision capabilities (image input)

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Clear and Direct Language
- Be specific and explicit in your instructions
- Avoid ambiguity and provide context when necessary

### 2. Multi-shot Learning
- Provide multiple examples to guide Claude's responses
- Use a consistent format for input-output pairs

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks
- Use phrases like "Let's approach this step-by-step" or "Think through this carefully"

### 4. Structured Outputs with XML Tags
- Use XML tags to define the desired response structure
- Example:
  ```
  Please provide a summary of the text in the following format:
  <summary>
  <main_points>
  [List the main points here]
  </main_points>
  <key_takeaways>
  [List key takeaways here]
  </key_takeaways>
  </summary>
  ```

### 5. Assigning Roles
- Give Claude a specific role or persona to guide its responses
- Example: "You are an expert software engineer reviewing code for security vulnerabilities."

## Utilizing Claude's 200k Context Window
- Leverage the large context window for tasks requiring extensive background information or long-form content analysis
- Break down large prompts into manageable chunks if necessary
- Use clear section headers or separators within the prompt for better organization

## Model Selection Guidelines
- Use Claude 3 Haiku for quick, straightforward tasks and when low latency is crucial
- Choose Claude 3 Sonnet for a balance of performance and cost in most general applications
- Opt for Claude 3 Opus for the most complex tasks, creative writing, or when the highest level of reasoning is required

## Integration Considerations
- Implement dynamic model selection based on task complexity and performance requirements
- Utilize Claude's vision capabilities for tasks involving image analysis or understanding
- Leverage Claude's multilingual abilities for global applications or translation tasks

## Error Handling and Fallback Strategies
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for API call failures
- Consider fallback options between Claude models (e.g., from Opus to Sonnet) in case of errors or timeouts
- Maintain support for OpenAI models as a secondary option if Claude services are unavailable

## Performance Monitoring
- Track and analyze the performance of different Claude models for various task types
- Use this data to refine model selection criteria and optimize prompt engineering techniques

By following these guidelines and best practices, we can effectively leverage the capabilities of Claude models within the LLM-Workflow Director, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

Remember: Always use the completion API for Claude interactions. The messages API is not officially supported for Claude 3 models and should not be used.
