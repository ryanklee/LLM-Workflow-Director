# Dog-food Ready Criteria for LLM-Workflow Director

The LLM-Workflow Director will be considered "dog-food ready" when it meets the following criteria:

1. Core Functionality:
   - Fully functional workflow management system with configurable stages and transitions
   - Direct integration with Claude API (Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus models)
   - Implemented and tested StateManager, ConstraintEngine, and PriorityManager
   - Functional sufficiency evaluation using LLM for stage completion assessment

2. LLM Integration:
   - Implemented tiered LLM approach (fast, balanced, powerful) with proper model selection logic
   - Efficient context management for Claude's 200k token window
   - Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls
   - Implemented caching system for optimizing API usage and costs

3. Project Structure and Documentation:
   - Enforced, well-defined project structure with validation mechanisms
   - Auto-documentation features for code, configurations, and project artifacts
   - Implemented DocumentationHealthChecker for assessing documentation quality

4. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
   - Implemented MockClaudeClient for simulating API responses in tests
   - Achieved minimum 90% code coverage
   - Performance benchmarks for critical operations

5. User Interaction:
   - Functional CLI for interacting with the workflow director
   - Implemented user confirmation mechanism for critical workflow steps

6. Security and Error Handling:
   - Secure handling of API keys and sensitive information
   - Implemented rate limiting for API calls
   - Robust error handling and logging throughout the system

7. Basic Advanced Features:
   - Implemented vector database for efficient information retrieval
   - Basic support for multi-modal input (text and simple image inputs)
   - Initial implementation of adaptive learning for LLM usage optimization

8. Workflow Capabilities:
   - Ability to guide through all stages of a basic software development process
   - Support for DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles
   - Capability to generate and manage coding conventions

9. Self-Application:
   - Successfully used the system to manage at least one full cycle of its own development process
   - Demonstrated ability to generate meaningful directions and evaluations for its own codebase

10. Documentation and Guides:
    - Comprehensive user guide for setting up and using the system
    - Developer documentation for extending the system
    - Up-to-date API documentation for all public interfaces

11. Performance and Scalability:
    - Demonstrated ability to handle projects with up to 10,000 files and 1,000,000 lines of code
    - Response time under 2 seconds for most operations

When these criteria are met, the LLM-Workflow Director will be considered "dog-food ready" and capable of effectively managing its own ongoing development process.
