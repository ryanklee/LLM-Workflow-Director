For detailed descriptions of each entity, please refer to the [full domain model documentation](https://your-project-wiki-or-docs-link.com/domain-model).

## Key Relationships

- WorkflowDirector interacts with most other components to orchestrate the workflow process.
- StateManager provides state information to various components and uses VectorStore for data storage.
- ClaudeManager interacts with multiple components for AI-assisted tasks and optimizations.
- UserInteractionHandler facilitates communication between the system and users.

This domain model reflects the direct integration with the Claude API, emphasizing Claude's specific features and capabilities, such as the tiered model approach (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus), vision capabilities, and the 200k token context window. The model also incorporates caching mechanisms and rate limiting to optimize API usage and costs.
